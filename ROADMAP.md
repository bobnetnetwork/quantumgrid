# QuantumGrid Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned development path for the QuantumGrid project. The roadmap is subject to change as new features are requested and priorities shift.

## Milestones

### 1. Initial Setup and Basic Microservices (Q4 2024)

- [ ] Set up the initial GitHub repositories for each microservice and the central `quantumgrid` repository.
- [ ] Create `Commons` repository with shared utilities, exceptions, and helper functions.
- [ ] Develop basic `User Service` for managing user authentication, authorization, and profiles.
- [ ] Develop `Post Service` for creating, editing, and deleting posts.
- [ ] Develop `Comment Service` for managing comments on posts and pages.
- [ ] Develop `Page Service` for managing static and dynamic pages.

### 2. Core Features and Integrations (Q1 2025)

- [ ] Implement `API Gateway` for routing external requests to appropriate microservices.
- [ ] Set up `Config Server` for centralized configuration management across all microservices.
- [ ] Integrate `User Service` with `Post Service` and `Comment Service` to manage user interactions.
- [ ] Develop `Email Service` for handling notifications and user communications.

### 3. Security and User Management Enhancements (Q2 2025)

- [ ] Implement role-based access control (RBAC) in `User Service` and integrate it across all microservices.
- [ ] Develop auditing and logging functionality to monitor user actions and system events.
- [ ] Set up secure authentication mechanisms, such as OAuth2 or JWT, for all microservices.

### 4. Scalability and Performance Optimization (Q3 2025)

- [ ] Introduce caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) to improve read performance for frequently accessed data.
- [ ] Optimize database queries and indexes in PostgreSQL and MongoDB for better performance.
- [ ] Implement horizontal scaling for key microservices to handle increased load.

### 5. Advanced Features and SEO Management (Q4 2025)

- [ ] Develop `Search Service` with full-text search capabilities for posts, pages, and comments.
- [ ] Develop `MetaSeo Service` to manage SEO-related metadata for better search engine optimization.
- [ ] Enhance `Page Service` with advanced content management features, such as versioning and rollback.

### 6. Client Applications Development (Q1 2026)

- [ ] Develop `Dashboard Client` using a modern frontend framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue) for content management, user management, and analytics.
- [ ] Develop `Frontend Client` for the public-facing website to display content managed through the CMS.
- [ ] Integrate `Dashboard Client` with all backend services via the `API Gateway`.
- [ ] Integrate `Frontend Client` with the `API Gateway` to fetch content dynamically.

### 7. Developer Tools and CI/CD Pipeline (Q2 2026)

- [ ] Set up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for all microservices and client applications.
- [ ] Implement automated testing frameworks for unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- [ ] Develop developer documentation and API reference guides.

### 8. Community Building and Documentation (Q3 2026)

- [ ] Expand project documentation, including detailed setup guides and usage instructions.
- [ ] Create tutorials and blog posts to help new users get started with QuantumGrid.
- [ ] Engage with the open-source community and encourage contributions.

## Future Ideas

- [ ] Implement a recommendation engine for personalized content suggestions.
- [ ] Develop a mobile application using the QuantumGrid backend.
- [ ] Integrate with third-party services, such as social media platforms or analytics tools.
- [ ] Create additional client applications for specific use cases (e.g., mobile app, desktop app).
