## Overview

Testing is an essential part of the development process in QuantumGrid. The project utilizes various types of testing to ensure that each component works correctly on its own and as part of the larger system.

## Unit Testing

**Objective**: Verify that individual units of source code (e.g., classes, methods) function as expected.

- **Scope**: Tests should focus on small, isolated pieces of functionality.
- **Tools**: JUnit, Mockito
- **Guidelines**:
  - Mock external dependencies to isolate the unit under test.
  - Aim for high coverage, especially for core logic.
  - Keep tests fast and focused on a single responsibility.

## Integration Testing

**Objective**: Ensure that different modules or services work together as expected.

- **Scope**: Tests should focus on interactions between modules or services, such as database access, API calls, or message queues.
- **Tools**: Spring Boot Test, Testcontainers
- **Guidelines**:
  - Use a real database or a containerized environment for testing database interactions.
  - Test the service layers, ensuring that they interact correctly with external systems.
  - Consider using Testcontainers to spin up temporary instances of dependent services.

## End-to-End Testing

**Objective**: Validate the entire application flow from start to finish.

- **Scope**: Tests should cover complete scenarios that a user might perform, involving multiple services and the full stack.
- **Tools**: Selenium, Cucumber, Postman/Newman
- **Guidelines**:
  - Simulate real user interactions with the system.
  - Ensure that all services integrate seamlessly and that data flows as expected.
  - Use headless browsers or API testing tools for automation.

## Test Coverage

**Objective**: Measure the amount of code that is covered by tests.

- **Tool**: JaCoCo
- **Guidelines**:
  - Aim for at least 80% coverage, but focus on covering critical and complex code paths.
  - Include both positive and negative test cases.
  - Review coverage reports to identify untested areas of the code.

## Running Tests

Tests can be run using the following commands:

### Running Unit Tests

```bash
./mvnw test
```

### Running Integration Tests

```bash
./mvnw verify -Pintegration
```

### Running End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests can be run using tools like Postman/Newman or Selenium. For example:

```bash
newman run postman_collection.json
```

## Tools and Frameworks

- **JUnit**: Used for writing and running unit tests.
- **Mockito**: Used for mocking dependencies in unit tests.
- **Spring Boot Test**: Provides support for integration testing of Spring Boot applications.
- **Testcontainers**: Used for running containerized dependencies during integration tests.
- **Selenium**: Used for browser-based end-to-end testing.
- **Cucumber**: Supports behavior-driven development (BDD) and end-to-end testing.
- **JaCoCo**: Used for generating code coverage reports.

## Best Practices

- **Write tests first (TDD)**: Consider using Test-Driven Development (TDD) to write tests before the actual implementation.
- **Keep tests independent**: Ensure that tests do not rely on the state left by previous tests.
- **Use meaningful names**: Give your test classes and methods descriptive names that indicate what they are testing.
- **Review and refactor tests**: Regularly review your tests to ensure they remain relevant and refactor them as needed.
