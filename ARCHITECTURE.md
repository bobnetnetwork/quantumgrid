# QuantumGrid Architecture

QuantumGrid follows a microservice architecture, where each service is responsible for a specific business functionality. This document provides an overview of the architecture and the inter-service communication, as well as the client applications that interact with the backend services.

## Microservice Overview

- **User Service**: Handles user management including authentication, authorization, and profile management.
- **Post Service**: Manages blog posts including creation, editing, and deletion.
- **Comment Service**: Manages comments associated with posts and pages.
- **Page Service**: Handles management of static and dynamic pages.
- **Email Service**: Manages sending emails for notifications and communication.
- **File Storage Service**: Responsible for handling file uploads and storage.
- **Search Service**: Provides search capabilities across posts, comments, and pages.
- **MetaSeo Service**: Manages metadata and SEO-related information for content.
- **API Gateway**: Acts as a single entry point for all client requests and routes them to appropriate microservices.
- **Config Server**: Centralizes the configuration management for all microservices.
- **Commons**: A shared library containing utilities, exceptions, and helper functions common to all services.

## Client Applications

QuantumGrid also includes two client applications that provide different interfaces and functionalities:

- **Dashboard Client**: A web-based administration panel built using a modern frontend framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue). This client is designed for administrators and content managers to manage users, content, and analytics. It integrates with the backend services via the API Gateway.

- **Frontend Client**: A public-facing web application that renders content dynamically managed through the CMS. It provides a seamless user experience by fetching content from the backend services through the API Gateway. This client is intended for general users who visit the website.

## Communication

- **Synchronous Communication**: Services communicate synchronously using REST APIs for operations that require immediate responses, such as user authentication or post retrieval.
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Services also use message brokers (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) to handle background tasks, notifications, and logging in an event-driven manner.

## Database Strategy

- **PostgreSQL**: Used for services requiring relational data management, such as User Service, Post Service, Comment Service, Page Service, Lectoring Service, and MetaSeo Service.
- **MongoDB**: Used for services requiring a flexible schema and document-based storage, such as File Storage Service, Search Service, and Email Service.

## Deployment

QuantumGrid is containerized using Docker and orchestrated using Kubernetes. Each microservice and client application is deployed as a separate container, ensuring scalability, resilience, and isolation.

## Monitoring and Logging

- **Centralized Logging**: Implemented using the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging and monitoring across all microservices.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana are used for monitoring the health and performance of the microservices and client applications.

## Continuous Integration and Deployment

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Jenkins is used to automate the build, test, and deployment processes for all services and client applications.
- **Code Quality**: SonarQube is integrated with Jenkins to provide continuous code quality checks and security vulnerability scans.
