## Security Best Practices

To help maintain the security of your QuantumGrid instance, we recommend the following best practices:

1. **Regularly update your instance**: Ensure you are using the latest version of QuantumGrid to benefit from security patches and updates.
2. **Monitor dependencies**: Keep all libraries and dependencies up to date.
3. **Use strong credentials**: Ensure that all accounts have strong, unique passwords.
4. **Limit access**: Restrict access to the QuantumGrid instance to only those who need it.
5. **Enable logging**: Enable logging and monitoring to detect any suspicious activity.

## Public Disclosure

We will coordinate public disclosure with the reporter of a vulnerability. If we receive a report of a vulnerability, we will:

1. Verify and fix the vulnerability.
2. Prepare a public advisory in coordination with the reporter.
3. Release a patch as soon as possible.
4. Announce the vulnerability via our official channels.

We believe in responsible disclosure and ask that reporters give us the opportunity to fix a vulnerability before it is made public.
