## Overview

QuantumGrid can be deployed in multiple environments to support development, testing, and production use cases. The deployment process varies slightly depending on the target environment but follows a general pattern of preparing the environment, configuring services, and deploying the application.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying QuantumGrid, ensure you have the following tools installed and configured:

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**: For containerized deployments.
- **Kubernetes** and **kubectl**: For Kubernetes-based deployments.
- **Git**: For source code management.
- **Java 21** and **Maven**: For building the project.

## Local Development Deployment

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bobnetnetwork/quantumgrid.git
   cd quantumgrid
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**:

   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and configure the environment variables as needed.

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Start Docker Compose**:

   Use Docker Compose to start all the required services.

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Build the Project**:

   Build the project using Maven.

   ```bash
   ./mvnw clean install
   ```

5. **Run the Services**:

   Start each microservice from your IDE or command line.

## Staging Deployment

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Set Up Staging Environment**:

   Ensure the staging environment has Docker and Docker Compose installed. Optionally, set up a Kubernetes cluster if using Kubernetes for staging.

2. **Configure Staging Environment Variables**:

   Update the `.env` file or Kubernetes secrets/config maps with the staging environment configurations.

3. **Deploy Services**:

   - **Docker Compose**: Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up -d`.
   - **Kubernetes**: Apply Kubernetes manifests.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/staging
   ```

4. **Test the Deployment**:

   Perform a series of tests to ensure the application is working as expected in the staging environment.

## Production Deployment

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Prepare Production Environment**:

   Set up the production environment with necessary infrastructure and security measures (e.g., firewalls, SSL certificates).

2. **Configure Production Environment Variables**:

   Securely manage environment variables and secrets using a tool like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.

3. **Deploy Using Kubernetes**:

   For production deployments, Kubernetes is recommended. Use the production-specific manifests:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/production
   ```

4. **Monitor and Verify Deployment**:

   Use monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana) and log management (ELK Stack) to monitor the health of the deployment.

## Kubernetes Deployment

### Overview

Kubernetes provides a scalable and resilient platform for deploying QuantumGrid in a clustered environment. 

### Setting Up Kubernetes

1. **Install Kubernetes**:
   Set up a Kubernetes cluster using a managed service (e.g., GKE, EKS, AKS) or a local solution like Minikube.

2. **Deploying to Kubernetes**:
   - Create Kubernetes manifests for each service.
   - Apply the manifests using `kubectl apply -f <manifest>.yaml`.

### Sample Kubernetes Manifest

Below is an example of a Kubernetes Deployment manifest for the User Service:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: user-service
  namespace: quantumgrid
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: user-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: user-service
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: user-service
          image: bobnetnetwork/user-service:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
          envFrom:
            - secretRef:
                name: user-service-secrets
```

## Environment Configuration

QuantumGrid requires different configurations based on the deployment environment. Key configuration files and environment variables should be adjusted accordingly:

- `.env` file for local and staging environments.
- Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets for production environments.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

- **Service Not Starting**: Check the logs using `docker logs <service_name>` or `kubectl logs <pod_name>` to identify the issue.
- **Database Connection Errors**: Ensure that database services are running and accessible. Check connection strings and credentials.
- **Kubernetes Pod Crashing**: Use `kubectl describe pod <pod_name>` to get more details about the pod's status and events.
